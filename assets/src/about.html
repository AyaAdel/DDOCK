          Together with our client, we formulate a precise job profile. We identify candidates in our network database
          and through research who match the profile. Our personnel consultants evaluate the results. Appropriate
          candidates are then contacted and reviewed again with specific reference to the position. When this is done,
          we send the client a selection of suitable and available candidates.
