                  3.3. All freelance services that the Candidate performs for the Client during the commission period
                  are liable to
                  commission. A Client is defined as a party with which the Candidate has formed a working relationship
                  through the
                  activity of DESIGNERDOCK. For this it is sufficient that the communication i.e. the forwarding of the
                  Client’s contact
                  details to the Candidate or the forwarding of the Candidate’s contact details to the Client or the
                  introduction of
                  Client to Candidate is a contributory factor in the establishment of this employment relationship. In
                  case of doubt, the
                  recruitment services provided by DESIGNERDOCK shall be considered to be a contributory causative
                  factor where a contract
                  relationship is formed between Candidate and Client within 24 months of the contact details being
                  provided.

                  3.4. This commission shall also be payable to DESIGNERDOCK where the Candidate is employed for an
                  activity other than
                  that for which his or her contact details were originally provided by DESIGNERDOCK. The commission is
                  also applicable
                  regardless of whether the work performed for the Client is in the same area of responsibility as the
                  contract
                  relationship that resulted from the original recruitment process or for other contracts for work,

                    details is not directly with the Client itself but rather with a third party that is closely related
                    in personal or
                    commercial terms to the Client such that the employment relationship is of an equivalent commercial
                    value for the
                    Client.

                    invoice to enable
                    DESIGNERDOCK to invoice it’s commission. For this it is sufficient if the Candidate submits a copy of
                    invoices they
                    have created to DESIGNERDOCK afterwards.

                    not before arrival of the DESIGNERDOCK commission invoice. In case of delays to payments by the Client
                    of 6 weeks or
                    more, the Candidate shall send the Client a written reminder and, if payment is still not forthcoming
                    within a further
                    3 weeks, a dunning letter. Further pursuit of non-payment is up to the Candidate. The Candidate is
                    obliged to inform
                    DESIGNERDOCK about any delays to payment by the Client and any measures taken by him or herself in
